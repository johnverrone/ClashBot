<insert build status and test coverage badges here>

A chat bot that will send Clash of Clans information to your favorite chat client. Currently only developed for GroupMe but Slack and Discord are in the works.

**What does it do?**
Sends notifications for the following:

- War start
- Any war attack on an enemy base (tells you who attacked who and for how many stars)
- Close war (2 hours remaining)
- War ends (will share results and final star count)
